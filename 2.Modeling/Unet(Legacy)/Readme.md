* Make sure that the model generates a `.ckpt` file, which stores the trained parameters. The checkpoint file can be used later for prediction.
* Use the **'best'** `.ckpt`, not **'final'** one, especially if the checkpoint does not gurantee the highest performace.
* The best trained parameter (`.ckpt`)
